Python CLI Uploader for Pacifica Core Services. This uploader wraps the
[Pacifica Python Uploader](https://github.com/pacifica-python-uploader)
library for Windows or Linux command line.


## CLIUploader

This is the main executable program it consists of a main program from
`uploader_cli` module. Users should be able to access the program from
the bin or scripts directories in their python environment.

## Configure Sub-Command

The `configure` subcommand generates a local configuration file for the
user. It will read the system configuration to preseed its defaults and
asks the user to enter the values required. An example configuration is
located [here](config/example.ini).

The system configuration is processed first and the two directories are,
`/etc/pacifica-cli/config.ini` then
`PYTHON_PREFIX/pacifica-cli/config.ini`. Which ever is found first the
client uses that as the system default.

The user configuration is processed second, if found. The directory the
client looks in by default is `~/.pacifica-cli/config.ini`. The `~`
translates to the users home directory on any platform.

### System Metadata Configuration

The metadata is managed by a JSON configuration file referenced by an
environment variable `UPLOADER_CONFIG`. By default the environment
variable is set to `uploader.json`. However, it could be managed at a
system level or changed on the command line by the `--config` option.

The contents of the metadata configuration file is complex and should
be read from
[here](https://github.com/pacifica/pacifica-python-uploader/blob/master/METADATA_CONFIGURATION.md).

## Upload Sub-Command

There are two sets of options to the upload sub-command. The first comes
from the missing values in the metadata configuration json file. The
second are common for all uploads and will be documented further.

### `--follow-links`

This will follow symlinked directories as you walk a directory tree
building the list of files to upload.

### `--nowait`

The uploader will not wait for the successful or failed ingest of the
upload. Instead you will have to query for this information later.

### `--local-retry`

Upload an already generated bundle by the `--local-save` option. This
option will honor the `--local-save` and `--tar-in-tar` options as
well.

### `--local-save`

The uploader will save off a copy of the uploaded bundle of data. The
path is defined as the argument to the option.

### `--tar-in-tar`

A second bundler will be running generating a TAR in a TAR for upload.

### `--dry-run`

Do just the query portion of the upload and print off what the metadata
will be set to. This will not upload or generate a local save or retry.

### `--interactive`

Interact with the results of the query engine to manually select the
values for each metadata entry requested.
